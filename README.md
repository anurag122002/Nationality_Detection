# Nationality_Detection: Project Overview

- Created a tool that can detect the nationality of a person based on their picture.
- Accumulated hundreds of pictures online utilising a chrome extension in the data collection process. Pictures of people from specific countries.
- Built and trained a deep learning model utilising tensorflow and keras.
- Lastly tested the accuracy of the model by making a python gui file with optimising tkinter library in python for creating gui's.

## Code and Resources used :-
1. **Python Version**: 3.10.13
2. **Packages**: Pandas, Numpy, tensorflow, tkinter, cv2, PIL, scikit-learn
3. **Chrome Extension for Downloading Images**: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/image-downloader/cnpniohnfphhjihaiiggeabnkjhpaldj

### One of the most important steps for this project was identifying/detecting faces in the images. For that the harcascade xml file was required :
